# calendar-planner

Purpose: A calendar planner using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and CDNS bootstrap, moment.js, and jQuery. When inputting a task for each time slot the task should save and still be there when the web page reloads. The tasks are also color coded based off of the time of day it is and whether they are past due, currently due, or upcoming.

Notes: For the most part the functionality works. There is an issue in that only the div around the save button is color coded by when the task is due. The biggest issue is that I have been struggling with localStorage so the tasks do not save when the save button is clicked. While they do stay on the page, when the page is reloaded the tasks do not reload with it.
